How to run the project's frontend with React

Setting up the project in React for the first time:

1. Install Node.js  
   Search for the Node.js download on google, and download the version that is compatible with your device

2. NAVIGATE TO YOUR TERMINAL  
   Type "git --version" to see if you have git installed no quotations

3. Navigate To my repository and copy the clone url  
   Go to terminal and type "git clone https://github.com/miguelm18/HealthCare-Platform.git" no quotations
   then type "git init" no quotations

4. Add The Extensions From The Picture

You should have the project downloaded onto your computer now

5. Navigate to the frontend folder of your project in your terminal  
   You should already be at the src directory  
   Type "cd frontend" to navigate into the frontend folder in the src directory

6. install the packages needed to make the front end work  
   You should still be at the frontend directory  
   Type "npm install react-router-dom" into the terminal  
   Type "npm install react-scripts" into the terminal  
   Type "npm install react-icons" into the terminal  

Starting the project in React after the first 5 steps are completed:

1. run the project
   Navigate to the frontend folder of your project in your terminal, type "cd frontend" if you aren't at the frontend folder yet  
   Type "npm start" into the terminal

2. Your project should appear in your web browser now  
   If you see an error related to web vital reporting, ignore it  

3. To log into the website, enter "user@gmail.com" as the email, and "password122333444455555!@#$%" as the password  
   This login information is used for testing  

How to stop the project:

1.  Make sure you have navigated to your frontend folder  
    Run the command "Ctrl + C" in your node terminal, not the powershell terminal

2.  The terminal should say "Terminate batch job (Y/N)?"  
    Type "Y" and press enter

3.  Close the project's tab in your web browser



# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# To Run Application Follow The Steps After Navigating To Frontend SRC And Opening A Terminal***

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
